        The new BMW M4 CS invites owners to experience the inimitable M feeling
        in all its depth and breadth. Its distinctive character profile places
        it exactly between the BMW M4 Competition Coup√© with M xDrive and the
        limited-run BMW M4 CSL special edition. The pure-bred performance
        talents of the new BMW M4 CS are the product of M typical racing genes,
        which offer constant reminders of their presence in everyday driving on
        the road and enjoy full expression out on the track.
